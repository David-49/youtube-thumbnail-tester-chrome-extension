# youtube-thumbnail-tester-chrome-extension

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Enable the developer options if not already enabled
- Click "Load unpacked extension..." (FR: "Charger l'extension non empaquet√©e")
- Navigate and select the repo's root directory


Then you should see the extension was installed

## Things to improve
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] The app needs an icon because for now we use the default google one...
- [ ] Install a linter on the project so that we all can collaborate without having so many useless changes to review
- [ ] Creating tests ? (even if @liior tried for one hour without any success)
- [ ] Animation on the YouTube Homepage to show where the thumbnail is updated. Like a scale up scale down on the thumbnail for example.
